# Open Exercices Unsupervised

## Challenge
- Data: https://eden.dei.uc.pt/~vitorgr/challenge1.npy
- Use DBSCAN to estimate the number of clusters in the dataset. ​
- Using the elbow method, confirm that the K-means algorithm agrees with the result found by DBSCAN for the number of clusters in the dataset. ​
- Check for noise in the result of the DBSCAN algorithm. ​
- Check and discuss the silhouette coefficient given by the DBSCAN and correlates it to the elbow method of kmeans.
